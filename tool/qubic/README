=================
Usage
=================
This software provides a biclustering program for microarray data. For a set of genes and a set of conditions, the program outputs a block-like structure which shows uniform pattern within the block, the block would contain only subsets of all given genes under subsets of all given conditions. 

Certain parts of the code uses open-source data structure library codes, including:
- fib <http://resnet.uoregon.edu/~gurney_j/jmpc/fib.html>, copyright information in fib.c
- Mark A. Weiss's data structure codes <http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~weiss/>

==================
Installation
==================
Simply put "qubic.tar.gz" in any directory, 

$ tar zxvf qubic.tar.gz

enter the folder "qubic" and type "make" then the compiled codes are within the same directory as the source.

Now this version is no longer compatible with cypwin...

==================
Inputs and outputs
==================
The major program in the provided package is `qubic`, it can parse two formats of files, discrete data and continuous data, and examples for each are provided. See help and look at all available options.

$ ./qubic -h

Take a look at `toy_example` (discrete data) first. And try to run clustering

$ ./qubic -i toy_example -d

-d is important here since it tells the program that this is discrete data.

Then look at a large microarray file of Ecoli (continuous data from http://m3d.bu.edu/norm/). Try to run

$ ./qubic -i Ecoli.microarray -f .25

This restricts no two output blocks overlap more than 0.25 of the size of each one. And the other parameters are default value.


For each input file, our program generates three output files, namely,'.blocks' file, '.chars'file and '.rules' file.

In '.blocks' file, you can see all the biclusters the program found, especially, we use a blank line to separate the positively and the negatively (if any) correlated genes in each bicluster.

As to '.chars' file, it provides the qualitative matrix of the microarray data to usrs with some details of how to discrete the data in '.rules' file. You can find further details about how to represent a microarray dataset with a qualitative matrix in our paper.


==================
Changelog
==================
Version 0.1 
- prototype of algorithm

Version 0.2
- new principle of selecting seeds for real data (make the step more efficient)
- new function that generate the biclusters (if any) contains the genes usrs provided: usrs can put the genes at hand in a 'genes' file.

Version 0.3
-new function that can expand the current blocks generated by our program in specific environment, take 'Ecoli' as an example,
 $./qubic -i Ecoli
 $./qubic -i CRP
 $./qubic -i Ecoli.chars -b CRP.blocks -s
and the program will generate a 'CRP.blocks.expansion' file containning the enlarged blocks in CRP.blocks.

Version 0.4
- when we use the parameter -r (>1), we have two methods, quantile_from_sorted_data and quantile_from_sorted_data_value, see details in read_array.c. now the results  have each own advantages on GO, KEGG and REGULON.-07.20.2009

Version 0.5
- ollect all the related code of bicluster in the same folder--01/22/2010

Version 1.0
- add the annotation as more as possible --01/24/2010
